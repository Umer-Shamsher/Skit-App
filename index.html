There should be two main sections. One demo, and the second one is game. 
In the demo, You'll show a quick guide of the game. As select while contestants are introducing themselves, student's name is pinned. Then the name of the student who was name was picked on luckydraw will assign the seat to the contestant who introduced. After doing this with every student, the game starts. There will be three rounds. Then the poll will be conducted in the group for voting for 40 seconds while the rapid quiz will be played. The most and least voted person is eliminated. The person who is eliminated will show his ball. If the contestant is found to be imposter then he/she will be given a hard task, and if he's safe an easy task. The task will appear on the screen, and the person who picked the seat for that contestant will select from them, and the student has to perform them. This will go on for three rounds. The person who is not eliminated will be the winner.
